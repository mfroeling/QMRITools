By exploiting the intrinsic redundancy in diffusion MRI using universal properties of the eigenspectrum of random covariance matrices, we remove noise-only principal components, thereby enabling signal-to-noise ratio enhancements. This yields parameter maps of improved quality for visual, quantitative, and statistical interpretation. By studying statistics of residuals, we demonstrate that the technique suppresses local signal fluctuations that solely originate from thermal noise rather than from other sources such as anatomical detail. Furthermore, we achieve improved precision in the estimation of diffusion parameters and fiber orientations in the human brain without compromising the accuracy and spatial resolution.},

  abstract      = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures, such as fractional anisotropy (FA), and trace are very sensitive to noise contained in the acquired diffusion weighted images. Typical isotropic smoothing methods reduce the high spatial frequency image content and blur the image features. We hypothesized that the diffusion tensor would be an approximate anisotropic Gaussian filter function because the blur will tend to be oriented parallel to the white matter structures. Thus, we implemented and evaluated an anisotropic Gaussian kernel smoothing method based on the diffusion tensor for preserving diffusion tensor structural features while significantly reducing the noise. We compared the diffusion tensor anisotropic filtering with isotropic Gaussian filtering, and a Perona-Malik (PM) filtering algorithm, which was derived from the intensity gradients of diffusion weighted images. Human brain DTI data with high SNR was used as a gold standard for evaluation. Overall, the anisotropic filters performed similarly, with slightly better performance using the DT anisotropic filter across the whole brain.},

Previous chemical shift-based water-fat separation methods used a relatively simple signal model that assumes both water and fat have a single resonant frequency. However, it is well known that fat has several spectral peaks. This inaccuracy in the signal model results in two undesired effects. First, water and fat are incompletely separated. Second, methods designed to estimate T(2) (*) in the presence of fat incorrectly estimate the T(2) (*) decay in tissues containing fat. In this work, a more accurate multifrequency model of fat is included in the iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least-squares estimation (IDEAL) water-fat separation and simultaneous T(2) (*) estimation techniques. The fat spectrum can be assumed to be constant in all subjects and measured a priori using MR spectroscopy. Alternatively, the fat spectrum can be estimated directly from the data using novel spectrum self-calibration algorithms. The improvement in water-fat separation and T(2) (*) estimation is demonstrated in a variety of in vivo applications, including knee, ankle, spine, breast, and abdominal scans.},

The standard deviation in the estimate of the tensor trace in a water phantom was reduced by more than 40{\%} and the artefactual anisotropy was reduced by more than 60{\%} when using the optimized scheme compared with a more conventional scheme for the same scan time, and marked improvements are demonstrated in the human brain with the optimized sequences. Use of these optimal schemes results in reduced scan times, increased precision, or improved resolution in diffusion tensor images. Magn Reson Med 42:515-525, 1999.},

  abstract        = {In addition to the diffusion coefficient, fitting the intravoxel incoherent motion model to multiple b-value diffusion-weighted MR data gives pseudo-diffusion measures associated with rapid signal attenuation at low b-values that are of use in the assessment of a number of pathologies. When summary measures are required, such as the average parameter for a region of interest, least-squares based methods give adequate estimation accuracy. However, using least-squares methods for pixel-wise fitting typically gives noisy estimates, especially for the pseudo-diffusion parameters, which limits the applicability of the approach for assessing spatial features and heterogeneity. In this article, a Bayesian approach using a shrinkage prior model is proposed and is shown to substantially reduce estimation uncertainty so that spatial features in the parameters maps are more clearly apparent. The Bayesian approach has no user-defined parameters, so measures of parameter variation (heterogeneity) over regions of interest are determined by the data alone, whereas it is shown that for the least-squares estimates, measures of variation are essentially determined by user-defined constraints on the parameters. Use of a Bayesian shrinkage prior approach is, therefore, recommended for intravoxel incoherent motion modeling.},

  abstract      = {The computational cost for the simulation of NMR spectra grows exponentially with the number of nuclei. Today, the memory available to store the Hamiltonian limits the size of the system that can be studied. Modern computers enable to tackle systems containing up to 13 spins [1], which obviously does not allow to study most molecules of interest in research. This issue can be addressed by identifying groups of spins or fragments that are not or only weakly interacting together, i.e., that only share weakly coupled spin pairs. Such a fragmentation is only permitted in the weak coupling regime, i.e., when the coupling interaction is weak compared to the difference in chemical shift of the coupled spins. Here, we propose a procedure that removes weak coupling interactions in order to split the spin system efficiently and to correct a posteriori for the effect of the neglected couplings. This approach yields accurate spectra when the adequate interactions are removed, i.e., between spins only involved in weak coupling interactions, but fails otherwise. As a result, the computational time for the simulation of 1D spectra grows linearly with the size of the spin system. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract      = {Endogenous magnetic resonance contrast based on the localized composition of fat in vivo can provide functional information. We found that the unequal pulse timings of the Uhrig's dynamical decoupling multipulse echo sequences significantly alter the signal intensity compared to conventional, equal-spaced Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequences. The signal increases and decreases depending on the tissue and sequence parameters, as well as on the interpulse spacings; particularly strong differences were observed in fatty tissues, which have a highly structured morphology and a wide range of chemical shifts and J-couplings. We found that the predominant mechanism for fat refocusing under multipulse echo sequences is the chemical structure, with stimulated echoes playing a pivotal role. As a result, specialized pulse sequences can be designed to optimize refocusing of the fat chemical shifts and J-couplings, where the degree of refocusing can be tailored to specific types of fats. To determine the optimal time delays, we simulated various Uhrig dynamical decoupling and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequence timings, and these results are compared to experimental results obtained on excised and in vivo fatty tissue. Applications to intermolecular multiple quantum coherence imaging, where the improved echo refocusing translates directly into signal enhancements, are presented as well.},

  abstract      = {Purpose: Linear least squares estimators are widely used in diffusion MRI for the estimation of diffusion parameters. Although adding proper weights is necessary to increase the precision of these linear estimators, there is no consensus on how to practically define them. In this study, the impact of the commonly used weighting strategies on the accuracy and precision of linear diffusion parameter estimators is evaluated and compared with the nonlinear least squares estimation approach. Methods: Simulation and real data experiments were done to study the performance of the weighted linear least squares estimators with weights defined by (a) the squares of the respective noisy diffusion-weighted signals; and (b) the squares of the predicted signals, which are reconstructed from a previous estimate of the diffusion model parameters. Results: The negative effect of weighting strategy (a) on the accuracy of the estimator was surprisingly high. Multi-step weighting strategies yield better performance and, in some cases, even outperformed the nonlinear least squares estimator. Conclusion: If proper weighting strategies are applied, the weighted linear least squares approach shows high performance characteristics in terms of accuracy/precision and may even be preferred over nonlinear estimation methods. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract      = {PURPOSE: Recent literature shows that diffusion tensor properties can be estimated more accurately with diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) than with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Furthermore, the additional non-Gaussian diffusion features from DKI can be sensitive markers for tissue characterization. Despite these benefits, DKI is more susceptible to data artifacts than DTI due to its increased model complexity, higher acquisition demands, and longer scanning times. To increase the reliability of diffusion tensor and kurtosis estimates, we propose a robust estimation procedure for DKI. METHODS: We have developed a robust and linear estimation framework, coined REKINDLE (Robust Extraction of Kurtosis INDices with Linear Estimation), consisting of an iteratively reweighted linear least squares approach. Simulations are performed, in which REKINDLE is evaluated and compared with the widely used RESTORE (Robust EStimation of Tensors by Outlier REjection) method. RESULTS: Simulations demonstrate that in the presence of outliers, REKINDLE can estimate diffusion and kurtosis indices reliably and with a 10-fold reduction in computation time compared with RESTORE. CONCLUSION: We have presented and evaluated REKINDLE, a linear and robust estimation framework for DKI. While REKINDLE has been developed for DKI, it is by design also applicable to DTI and other diffusion models that can be linearized.},

The research was approved by the institutional ethics committee review board, and the volunteers provided written consent before the study. Five male amateur long- distance runners underwent an MR examination (DTI, T1- weighted MR imaging, and T2-weighted MR imaging with fat suppression) of both upper legs 1 week before, 2 days after, and 3 weeks after they participated in a marathon. The tensor eigenvalues (l1 , l2 , and l3 ), the mean diffusiv- ity, and the fractional anisotropy (FA) were derived from the DTI data. Data per muscle from the three time-points were compared by using a two-way mixed-design analysis of variance with a Bonferroni posthoc test. The DTI protocol allowed imaging of both complete up- per legs with adequate signal-to-noise ratio and within a 20-minute imaging time. After the marathon, T2-weighted MR imaging revealed grade 1 muscle strains in nine of the 180 investigated muscles. The three eigenvalues, mean diffusivity, and FA were significantly increased (P , .05) in the biceps femoris muscle 2 days after running. Mean diffusivity and eigenvalues l1 and l2 were significantly (P , .05) increased in the semitendinosus and gracilis mus- cles 2 days after the marathon. A feasible method for DTI measurements of the upper legs was developed that fully included frequently injured muscles, such as hamstrings, in one single imaging ses- sion. This study also revealed changes in DTI parameters that over time were not revealed by qualitative T2-weight- ed MR imaging with fat suppression.},
